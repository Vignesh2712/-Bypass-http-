# Bypass-http
Automatized tool to bypass 403 and 401 HTTP status.

## ðŸš¨ Attention Users:
This repository contains a tool designed for educational purposes only ans is intended solely for testing, learning, and demonstrating cybersecurity practices.
Don't use this code and knowledge to attack / pentest unauthorized targets.

## Usage article
I will soon write an article about this tool to help you understand how it works, with real examples.

## Guide
### Usage
```
Usage: bypass_http.py [-h] -i I -a A [-p P] [-v V] [-m M] [-s S]
Arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -i I        IP of the target, **Required**
  -a A        PATH of the target, **Required**
  -p P        PORT of the target, 80 by default
  -v V        VERSION of the target protocol, HTTPS/2.0 by default
  -m M        METHOD of the inital error, GET by default
  -s S        SECONDS between each request sent, 1 by default
```
Add the default headers in the default_headers.txt like this:
  - header: value

### What this tool does
This tool test multiple 403 and 401 bypass tricks in this order (form most to less common exploits):
  Testing all HTTP methods
  Path fuzzing
  Downgrade protocol version
  Headers fuzzing
  User-Agent fuzzing

If you want to learn more about these tricks, see this article: https://blog.vidocsecurity.com/blog/401-and-403-bypass-how-to-do-it-right/

### Custom
If you want to custom the different tests of this tool, you can change the .txt files in lists/
  agent.txt -> different User-Agent tested
  headers.txt -> differents headers tested
  headers_value.txt -> differents values for the previous headers
  path.txt -> differents paths tested to bypass, 'admin' is replaced by the real path during the tests

## In the future
### Adding features
Many features will be added in the future, like case-switching and Hop-By-Hop exploits.
